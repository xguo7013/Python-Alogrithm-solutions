Input Format

A single line of input containing the string .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the three most common characters along with their occurrence count each on a separate line. 
Sort output in descending order of occurrence count. 
If the occurrence count is the same, sort the characters in alphabetical order.

Sample Input 0

aabbbccde
Sample Output 0

b 3
a 2
c 2
Explanation 0


Here, b occurs  times. It is printed first.
Both a and c occur  times. So, a is printed in the second line and c in the third line because a comes before c in the alphabet.

Note: The string  has at least  distinct characters.

solution 1:
#use sorted function
#first use Counter to get how many times for each character, sort them by alphbet order first.
#then use another sort function to sort their value, itemgetter(1), reverse =True : descending order.

    s = input()
    from collections import Counter
    from operator import itemgetter
    result=Counter(s)
    for item in (sorted(sorted(result.items()),key = itemgetter(1),reverse=True)[:3]):
        print (item[0], item[1])
        
        
        
 solution 2:
 
 STEP 1: Create a list, letters, of size . Initialize each element to .

STEP 2: Traverse through the input string . If a character in the string is 'a', then increment letter by . If 'b' is found, then increment letter by  and so on.

STEP 3: Now run a loop three times. Inside the loop, store the maximum value of letters in the variable max_letter.

STEP 4:. In the scope of the previous loop, run another loop and find the index of the first occurrence of max_letter. Now, print the appropriate letter associated with that index and the max_letter.
 
 
 
 S = raw_input()
letters = [0]*26

for letter in S:
    letters[ord(letter)-ord('a')] += 1

for _ in range(3):
    
    max_letter = max(letters)
    
    for index in range(26):
        if max_letter == letters[index]:
            print chr(ord('a')+index), max_letter
            letters[index] = -1
            break
